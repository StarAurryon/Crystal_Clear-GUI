  <p class="lead font-weight-normal">This is the webapp of the open source project <a href="https://github.com/ludovicschwartz/Crystal_Clear">Crystal Clear</a>.
    The idea of this project is to apply Deep Learning image superresolution techniques to spectrogram "images" generated from an audio
    file in order to get a better quality of audio.</p>
  <p class="lead font-weight-normal">On the Home page, you can upload a file which will be processed by the latest version of the audio superresolution model.</p>
  <p class="lead font-weight-normal">On the Samples page, you can find audio samples of 30 sec already processed by the algorithm. In those samples, the original file is a low quality audio file 
    which has never been seen by the algorithm.</p>
